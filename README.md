# My Story Collection

Welcome to my personal story collection! This is a GitHub Pages site where I share my stories and experiences.

## Structure
- `index.html` - The main page that lists all stories
- `stories/` - Directory containing all story markdown files
- `css/` - Directory containing styling files

## How to Add New Stories
1. Create a new markdown file in the `stories/` directory
2. Use the following format for your story:
```markdown
---
title: Your Story Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---

Your story content goes here...
```

## Local Development
To run this site locally, you can use any markdown previewer or a simple HTTP server.
