# My First Story

Welcome to my first story! This is an example of how you can write your stories using Markdown. You can use all the standard Markdown features:

## Headers
You can create headers of different levels using the `#` symbol.

## Text Formatting
- **Bold text** using `**text**`
- *Italic text* using `*text*`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ using `~~text~~`

## Lists
You can create both ordered and unordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Or bullet points:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

## Code Blocks
You can even include code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Images
You can add images using Markdown syntax:
![Alt text](path/to/your/image.jpg)

## Links
And create links to other pages:
[Link text](https://example.com)

Feel free to use any of these Markdown features in your stories. The possibilities are endless!
